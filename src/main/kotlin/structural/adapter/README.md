We have an application that obtains information about the state from an external API
meteorology of a city from its name.

This API reports the following information in JSON format:

- City ID
- Wind Speed
- Weather State

This information in JSON format is consumed by various clients.

We also integrate information with a data visualization tool.
This tool can make queries to our application and receives the
information in XML format.
